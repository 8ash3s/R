# Third Space Lounge Website

A warm, scrolling story page for a coffee/weed/beer third-space concept with rentable rooms, a jazz lounge, and an investor placement area.

## Quick start (non-coders)
1. Open `site/index.html` directly in your browser for a simple preview.
2. For the smoothest experience, run a tiny local server and visit http://localhost:8000:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server --directory site 8000
   ```
   Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server when you are done.

## What you’ll see
- **Hero:** immediate overview and scroll cue.
- **Rentable rooms:** studio pods, listening rooms, creator suites, and social parlors.
- **Warm jazz lounge:** intimate seating, acoustic details, and service highlights.
- **Investors & ads:** tasteful room takeovers and ad placements for brands.
- **Booking form:** lightweight request form with inline confirmation.

## Editing
- HTML lives in `site/index.html`.
- Styling is in `site/styles.css`.
- Scroll/reveal behavior and the form notice are in `site/script.js`.
